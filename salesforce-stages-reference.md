## SME Effort Forecasting Calculation Framework

### Base Calculation Formula
```
Total SME Effort (FTE-weeks) = Σ(Stage SME Hours × Duration Multiplier × Resource Multiplier × Complexity Factor)
Total SME Effort (FTE-months) = Total SME Effort (FTE-weeks) ÷ 4.33
Total SME Effort (FTE-quarters) = Total SME Effort (FTE-weeks) ÷ 13
```

### Variables Definition
- **Stage SME Effort (FTE-weeks)**: Base effort in FTE-weeks required for each stage per service line
- **Duration Multiplier**: Adjustment factor based on deal category size
- **Resource Multiplier**: Adjustment factor based on resource availability and allocation
- **Complexity Factor**: Additional multiplier for technical complexity (1.0 = standard, 1.5 = complex, 2.0 = highly complex)

### Time Unit Conversion Factors
- **Weeks to Months**: Divide by 4.33 (average weeks per month)
- **Weeks to Quarters**: Divide by 13 (weeks per quarter)
- **Months to Quarters**: Divide by 3 (months per quarter)

### Forecasting Timeline Calculation
```
Forecasted Timeline (weeks) = Σ(Stage Duration × Efficiency Factor × Resource Availability)
Forecasted Timeline (months) = Timeline (weeks) ÷ 4.33
Forecasted Timeline (quarters) = Timeline (weeks) ÷ 13
```

### Resource Planning Matrix
```
| Service Line | Stage | Cat A (≥$50M) | Cat B ($25-50M) | Cat C ($5-25M) |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|

## Implementation Notes

### Configuration Process
1. Review each service line section and populate the [TO BE CONFIGURED] fields based on historical data and business requirements
2. Adjust deal category thresholds based on your organization's deal sizing standards
3. Calibrate complexity factors based on past project experiences
4. Validate calculations against actual project outcomes

### Usage Guidelines
- Use this reference as a template for creating detailed resource and timeline forecasts
- Regularly update the configuration values based on actual performance data
- Consider seasonal variations and resource availability when applying multipliers
- Review and adjust calculations quarterly to maintain accuracy

### Extension Framework
This document structure can be easily extended to include additional service lines by:
1. Creating a new service line section following the MW/ITOC template
2. Adding corresponding entries to the Resource Planning Matrix
3. Updating the SME Effort Forecasting calculations to include the new service line
