**Analysis Period:** August 1-31, 2025  
**Categories Included:** ALL categories (Cat A, Cat B, Cat C, Sub $5M)  
**Status:** FINAL CORRECTED - Accurate database queries and calculations

## Executive Summary - FINAL CORRECTED

- **Total Opportunities:** 369 (with August timeline activity)
- **Total Proportional FTE:** **187.4 FTE** 
- **Timeline Records:** 1,190 records with August overlap

### Key Corrections Made
1. **TCS competitive play:** Correctly shows **0.000 FTE** (not 2.600 FTE as incorrectly reported)
2. **Category Coverage:** Now includes ALL categories (Cat A, B, C, Sub $5M)
3. **Date Filtering:** Properly filters for August 2025 overlap
4. **Database Schema:** Uses correct column names and table structure

## Calculation Methodology - VERIFIED

**Proper August Overlap Filter:**
- Only stages where `stage_start_date ≤ 2025-08-31` AND `stage_end_date ≥ 2025-08-01`
- Uses actual database schema with correct column names

**Proportional FTE Formula:**
```
August FTE = (Stage FTE Required) × (August Overlap Days) / (Total Stage Days)

Where:
- August Overlap Days = max(0, min(stage_end, Aug31) - max(stage_start, Aug1) + 1)
- Total Stage Days = stage_end - stage_start + 1
```
